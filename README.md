# My-Portfolio

This is my first portfolio website, which I built using 'Gemini CLI' and it was an amazing experience. My family and loved ones helped me in this regard. It is a basic portfolio showcasing my aspirations and hopes. Working about 6+ years, day by day, step by step, I'm gaining experience. The website also highlights the Projects Sections, My Skills & My Bio. I found it really exciting in this short journey.
